Meet Arne Hedstrom, 

I am a passionate cybersecurity professional with over 25 years of experience.  
I excel at troubleshooting, process improvement, and leveraging the strengths and talents of a team.
Indentifying and removing roadblocks are important to me.  I enjoy sharing my experience and perspective with others.

The part of cybersecurity that interests me most is the need for constant refinement and improvement that is required to stay ahead of the ever changing landscape of security.
What I can bring to an organization is the ability to find creative solutions while elevating the team throught passionate and positive engagement.
